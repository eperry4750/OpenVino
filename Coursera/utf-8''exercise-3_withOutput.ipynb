    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The video course covered some potential implementations using the `wait()` function, including the zero timeout wait.\n",
    "While the zero timeout example in the video works well, it goes through all the requests over and over again until one of them is done.\n",
    "In this exercise, you will implement multiple inference that simply waits for the first finished slot using Python queues and inference callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Python queues have a couple of interesting features that make them work well with the multiple request inference workload.\n",
    "One is that Python queues are thread-safe. \n",
    "Without going in to too much detail, this means that the queue is safe to use in an asynchronous setting, like our requests.\n",
    "The second feature is the get() function (like a \"pop\" function). If the queue is empty when get() is called, it will wait until an item becomes available. We will begin with an optional section for those who are unfamiliar or need a review of Python Queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (Optional) Step 1: Python queue\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is designed to give you a brief introduction to Python queue. \n",
    "If you are already familiar, skip to step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python queues are data structures that are accessed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.\n",
    "When used in an asynchronous workload, this can be used to access the jobs as they complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a brief example of using queue in an asynchronous setting.\n",
    "This example uses threading instead of inference engine, to keep the example simple.\n",
    "Each thread sleeps for some time, and then puts a tuple containing the id of the thread and how long it slept for.\n",
    "The main thread will wait on the queue, and print out the contents of the tuple."
